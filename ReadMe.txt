Hi there!
Hope you're doing well!

As this was actually a fun exercise I couldn't manage to avoid the modal to show when the delete button was clicked.

Tried changing the state that allows the component to be shown but it didn't help.

I hope we could talk about it so I could learn how to do it as well as learning a more efficient way of coding.
